Practice Exam question
Hints and Tips by Mike OMalley.


This question has 2 parts:
* name the GUI Components used, and,
* describe how the GUI was constructed.

For the second part, think about the layout managers you would need to construct this GUI.

Hint: Create a Story Board - draw the GUI, carve it up into sections and apply a layout manager
to each section.  Then use another layout mananger to combine the pieces.

A great way to check your answer this practice question
(when you are ydoing your revision before the exam)
is to write the code to actually build the required GUI.
