Practice Exam question
Hints and Tips by Mike OMalley.

NOTE:
* A great way to explore this question and check your answer
  to this question (when you are doing your revision before the exam)
  is to write the code to actually build the required GUI.

This question has 2 parts:
* name the GUI Components used, and,
* describe how the GUI was constructed.

For the second part, think about the layout managers you would need to construct this GUI.

Hint: Create a Story Board - draw the GUI, carve it up into sections and apply a layout manager
to each section.  Then use another layout mananger to combine the pieces.
